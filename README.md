# Warp
A ray casting 3D game in development.
Curious about the world of computer graphics, I am exploring the techniques and algorithms used by the very first 3D games. This game Warp is inspired by DOOM 1993. Since computer graphics has come a long way and many APIs are no longer available, I decided to build my game on the cross platform SDL2 framework.
